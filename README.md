## üìã About The Project

This project was developed to solve the common problem of finding available parking spots in busy areas. It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of a car in a parking slot. The data is processed by a NodeMCU microcontroller and sent to the Blynk IoT platform, allowing a user to check for open spots from their phone before they arrive.
